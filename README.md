# Invasion aka Space Invaders
Found this old python project in an old drive. This was my first Python game ever, made in CPGE PTSI.
Couldn't find the last version but this one works fine.
The structure isnt great (too much repetitions) but the looks are nice. Had 17/20 with -3 for lack of comments. It's in french because teacher didnt want anything in English (lol).

Coded in Python 3.6.
